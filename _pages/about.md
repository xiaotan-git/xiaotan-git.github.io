I am a tenure-track professor at the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing. I am also jointly appointed at the International Institute of Beihang University, Hangzhou. Prior to this position, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at AMBER Lab, California Institute of Technology, USA. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden in May 2023. 


Research Interests
======
I have a broad interest in control, estimation, optimization and formal methods, and their applications in robotics. My research areas include
- Secure and risk-aware state estimation
- Learning for control and control for learning
- Safe control for nonlinear systems
- Formal methods in robotics
- Multi-agent systems
