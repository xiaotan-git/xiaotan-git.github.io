I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [AMBER Lab](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/), California Institute of Technology, USA.  I am currently collaborating with [Prof. Aaron Ames](http://ames.caltech.edu/) and [Prof. Paulo Tabuada](https://www.seas.ucla.edu/~tabuada/) on investigating safe autonomy under sensor spoofing attacks. Prior to this position, I held a short Postdoctoral Researcher position at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, supervised by [Prof. Dimos V. Dimarogonas](https://people.kth.se/~dimos/). In the same group, I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in May, 2023. My [Ph.D. thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1750193&dswid=9743) is about safe and correct control design for nonlinear systems. I was visiting [Prof. Antonis Papachistodoulou](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/antonis-papachristodoulou/) at University of Oxford, UK, in early 2023.

Research Interests
======
I have a broad interest in control, estimation, optimization and formal methods, and their applications in robotics. My research aeras include
- Secure and risk-aware state estimation
- Safe control for nonlinear systems
- Formal methods in robotics
- Multi-agent systems
